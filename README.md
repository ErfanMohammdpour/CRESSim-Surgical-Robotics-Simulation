## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Missing Unity Build
If the Unity build is missing, you can still:

- ✅ Run `python manage.py train-il` (uses mock demos)
- ✅ Run `python manage.py train-rl --mock` (mock RL training)
- ✅ Run comprehensive tests and evaluation

### GPU vs CPU Performance
- 🚀 **GPU recommended** for training (3-5x faster)
- 💻 **CPU sufficient** for evaluation and demos
- 🔧 Set `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=""` to force CPU usage

### Dataset Issues
- ✅ Check `data/kvasir_seg/` contains >1000 images
- ✅ Verify `data/endoscapes/` structure if using optional dataset
- 🔄 Run `python manage.py bootstrap` to re-download

### Training Issues
- 📊 Monitor TensorBoard logs for training progress
- 🛡️ Check safety violation logs for shield effectiveness
- 📈 Review evaluation metrics for performance assessment

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Success Criteria
